# ELEFAN
New ELEFAN
This is where you can download ELEFAN in R's source code. 
I would recommend using devtools::install_github("AaronGreenber/ELEFAN") to install this package into R.
Somewhere on the internet there is likely to be a manual and other supporting information. 
I don't know how this code is licensed, or even if it has a license. However, I suspect that you will not 
get in trouble for forking it, testing it, and upgrading it.  If you have any questions please email me or Daniel Pauly.
