Title: A package for ELectronic Length Frequency ANalysis of fish
Description: A method for the "tracing" of growth curves through fish
    length-frequency samples sequentially arranged in time.  The method allows
    for an objective extraction of growth parameters whenever representative
    samples are available from a fish population.  The method is suited both to
    the analysis of growth in tropical stocks and in temperate stocks where it
    oscillates seasonally.
