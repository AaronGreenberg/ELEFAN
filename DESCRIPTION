Title: A package for ELectronic Length Frequency ANalysis of fish
Description: A method for the "tracing" of growth curves through fish length-frequency samples sequentially arranged in time.  The method allows 
			for an objective extraction  of growth parameters whenever representative samples are available from a fish population.  The method is 
			suited both to the analysis of growth in tropical stocks and in temperate stocks where it oscillates seasonally.
